##### Project Status:

- **Status**: Completed
- **Start Date**: 2017-02-01
- **End Date**: 2017-07-01

##### Overview:

<div class="justify-text">

I developed a full-phased algorithm to predict color consumption for Thanbee Printing Plant Ltd, a T-shirt printing company, to optimize resource usage and reduce wastage in their printing operations. Using Photoshop, I calculated the intricate design areas on T-shirts with an accuracy greater than 99.5%. This algorithm allowed the company to predict color usage more effectively before the actual printing process, leading to cost savings and improved production efficiency.
