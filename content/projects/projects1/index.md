##### Project Status:

- **Status**: Completed
- **Start Date**: 2019-02-01
- **End Date**: 2019-06-30

##### Overview:

<div class="justify-text">
I developed an Excel VBA-based line balancing algorithm for the Ready-Made Garment (RMG) sector in Bangladesh, specifically for <a href="https://gmsbd.com" target="_blank">GMS Composite Knitting Ind. Ltd.</a>, the largest facility in Bangladesh, employing over 17,000 workers. The tool provides a quick, suboptimal solution when a worker is absent, which is a frequent issue in labor-heavy industries like RMG. This absenteeism would typically result in significant production loss, but the algorithm was able to improve production efficiency by 14%, minimizing the disruption caused by the absence of workers. The tool is now extensively used at GMS Composite for line balancing, ensuring that production is balanced and optimized despite daily workforce fluctuations.

##### Key Responsibilities:

- **Lead Developer**: I was responsible for designing and developing the entire line balancing algorithm using Excel VBA.
- Created a tool that provides quick alternative solutions for worker absence, maintaining balanced production lines.
- Analyzed production line data to identify inefficiencies in the garment production process and ensure minimal downtime.
- Provided training to staff on how to use the tool, ensuring smooth integration into daily operations.

##### Tools & Technologies:

- **Languages**: Excel VBA
- **Other Tools**: Microsoft Excel

##### Current Progress:

<div class="justify-text">

The project was successfully completed and integrated into the production workflow of GMS Composite Knitting Ind. Ltd. The solution led to a 14% improvement in production efficiency by mitigating the loss caused by worker absenteeism, ensuring balanced production lines. This tool continues to be used extensively at GMS Composite for optimizing production.
