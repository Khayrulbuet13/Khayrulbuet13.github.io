##### Project Status:

- **Status**: Completed
- **Start Date**: 2016-05-01
- **End Date**: 2016-12-01

---

##### Overview:
<div class="justify-text">

As the project lead, I led a team in designing and building a particle sifting machine aimed at optimizing the preparation of mold sand. We conducted a customer survey to gather design requirements and utilized a Quality Function Deployment (QFD) chart to refine the specifications. The machine was designed in SolidWorks 2013 and constructed from scratch by our team. Due to its functionality and usefulness, the BUET Foundry Lab expressed interest in adopting the machine for their mold sand preparation processes. The machine is now in regular use at the lab, significantly improving efficiency and precision in their sifting operations.
