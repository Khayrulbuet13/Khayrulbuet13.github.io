##### Overview:

This project focuses on leveraging Transformer-based machine learning models to predict cell trajectories in microfluidic devices. Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for optimizing the design of devices such as deterministic lateral displacement (DLD), which are widely used in cell sorting and separation processes. The developed model uses Transformer architecture to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in cell movements, providing more accurate predictions compared to traditional methods.

The insights gained from this model can greatly enhance the design and functionality of microfluidic devices, leading to improvements in biomedical applications such as cell sorting and drug testing.
