##### Project Status:

- **Status**: Ongoing
- **Start Date**: 2024-01-01
- **End Date**: Not applicable yet

##### Overview:

<div class="justify-text">

In this project, we present a cutting-edge approach to lymphocyte cell classification using Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Transfer Learning techniques. Our dataset comprises 80,000 images, supporting the training and validation of cell classification models. After installing our pip-installable package, users can seamlessly download and use the dataset. 

We focus on optimizing a larger teacher model for T4 vs B cell classifications and training a smaller student model that achieves approximately double the inference speed and requires about 50% less computational resources. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of Transfer Learning for T8 vs B cell classifications, allowing the model to perform zero-shot inference and be fine-tuned for other lymphocyte cell types. 

The project also involves deploying the model on an FPGA platform to achieve real-time T-cell detection, advancing the potential for real-time biomedical applications.
