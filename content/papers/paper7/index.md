##### Abstract

<div class="justify-text">
Microfluidic devices have found extensive applications in mechanical, bio- medical, chemical, and materials research. However, the high initial cost, low resolution, inferior feature fidelity, poor repeatability, rough surface finish, and long turn-around time of traditional prototyping methods limit their wider adoption. In this study, a strategic approach to a deterministic fabrication process based on in-situ image analysis and intermittent flow control called image-guided in-situ maskless lithography (IGIs-ML), has been proposed to overcome these challenges. By using dynamic image analysis and integrated flow control, IGIs-ML provides superior repeatability and fidelity of densely packed features across a large area and multiple devices. This general and robust approach enables the fabrication of a wide variety of microfluidic devices and resolves critical proximity effect and size limitations in rapid prototyping. The affordability and reliability of IGIs-ML make it a powerful tool for exploring the design space beyond the capabilities of traditional rapid prototyping.
