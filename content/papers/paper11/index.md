##### Abstract

<div class="justify-text">
Enhancing the mechanical properties of polyamide nanocomposites is crucial for various industrial applications. This study investigates the synergistic effects of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) chirality and maleic anhydride (MA) grafting using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that the mechanical strength of the nanocomposites improves significantly at optimal MA concentrations, with specific SWCNT chirality playing a key role in this enhancement. These findings provide critical insights for designing stronger polyamide nanocomposites through effective reinforcement strategies.
