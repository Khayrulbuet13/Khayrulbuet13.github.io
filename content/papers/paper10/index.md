##### Abstract

<div class="justify-text">
Observing and quantifying immune cell transport during cancer immunotherapy remains a challenge in the field. This paper presents an advanced 3D vessel-tumor model to study T cell transport and interaction with tumors in vitro. Using a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model with the Cooke-Deserno membrane representation technique, the study simulated the influence of vascular glycocalyx (VGCX) on ligand-receptor binding between T cells and endothelial cells. Results demonstrated the significant effect of the endothelial glycocalyx on T cell transport and evaluated the impact of PD-1 inhibition on tumor killing. These findings provide critical insights into immune cell transport dynamics during cancer immunotherapy, advancing the understanding of tumor-immune interactions.
